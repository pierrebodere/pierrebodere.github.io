##### I am a PhD candidate in Economics at New York University. 

In my research, I use methods from Empirical Industrial Organization to study access to Education, wait times in Healthcare, and diversity of content in the News market.

In my Job Market Paper, I study the design of early childhood education policies in the United States.

I am on the job market for the Academic Year 2022-2023 and will be available for interviews at the ASSA and EEA meetings. Click [here](content/bodere_academic_cv_nyu.pdf) for my CV.
